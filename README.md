# Are Last.FM Playcounts Affected by Pitchfork Scores?:
#A Data Analysis

<p>Pitchfork is a music review website that began in the late 1990s, famous for its witty album reviews (scored from 0.0 to 10.0 by 0.1 increments) and influence among serious music fans.</p>

<p>But just how influential is it really?</p>

<p>That's the question I will answer here. In doing so, I will consider Pitchfork rating's effect on album playcounts from the Last.FM music data service after genre and release date are factored out, using an ANCOVA (an ANOVA with one or more continuous variables).</p>

<p>In this repo are the analysis (the Jupyter notebook) and the data set (the CSV).</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
